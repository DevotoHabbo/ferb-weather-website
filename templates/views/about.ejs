        <p>This site was created by Ferb. It uses data from mapbox.com and darksky.net!. I am sorry but i can't show you the photo of myself yet due to lacking of confident, but who know about what will come in the future?</p>
        <p>I also consider myself as one of the biggest fan of software development due to my desire to build things around life</p>
        <p>Another bad habit of mine is overusing the front-family: "New Courrie" which somehow become one of my worst addiction when I build my application</p>
